# Analizing the context of child poverty in Berlin

Poverty is not only a material matter; it affects childrenâ€™s everyday life, their social network, their educational chances, even their health. Associated with social segregation, which prevents children to be in touch with other milieus, it can become a hardly escapable trap.

In order to better understand if, how and why child poverty is clustered in Berlin, we collected more than 100 geodata features from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/51.330/10.453">OpenStreetMap<a>  and <a href="https://daten.berlin.de/">Berlin Open Data platform<a>  and aggregated them to the level of the 542 planning areas, the smallest statistical areas, on which social data is publicly available. 

Have a look at a selection of our data and results on our <a href="https://appyouthinthecity.herokuapp.com/">web app<a>!

This project was conducted by Maciej Szuba , Nichanok Auevechanichkul and Safia Ahmedou as part of a Data Science Bootcamp at Le Wagon (batch #874) in September 2022.
